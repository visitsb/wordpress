COPY apache2-wordpress.sh /usr/local/bin/

# Keep Wordpress default entrypoint; do not override it, instead override the CMD
# https://github.com/docker-library/wordpress/blob/master/php7.2/apache/Dockerfile
# ENTRYPOINT ["docker-entrypoint.sh"]

# FYI: Reminder that if ENTRYPOINT is changed in child image
# it resets parent images CMD (makes it null so child image 
# to explicitly specify CMD).

# When environment variable WORDPRESS_ROOTDIR is set
# The subfolder will be created under default Wordpress root dir
